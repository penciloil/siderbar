    <h1>I took the truck up to Boston
        Don't make it up there too often
        High beams on, it starts to pour
        Radio loud, I-84
        Got the crew back together
        It feels like it's been forever
        But after a drink, they left the bar
        What'd you expect? They know how we are
        'Cause I know it goes bad to worse, you said it first
        It's hopeless, we can't lift that curse
        'Cause we both know we ain't got self-control
        And I'll always come when you bang on my door
        So I stayed overnight
        But I got going at first light
        I left a note, "Happy New Year"
        Under an empty bottle of beer
        And drove straight back to work
        My head still throbbing, my throat sore
        But when I got home and opened the door
        I wasn't surprised to see your bag on the floor
        'Cause I know it goes bad to worse, you said it first
        It's hopeless, we can't lift that curse
        'Cause we both know we ain't got self-control
        And I'll always come when you bang on my door
        Clothes still on, wake up on the floor
        Don't think I need to make this trip anymore
        'Cause half of me knows it's gonna get dark
        But when you come around, I fall apart
        'Cause I know it goes
        Bad to worse, you said it first
        It's hopeless, we can't lift that curse
        'Cause we both know we ain't got self-control
        And I'll always come when you bang on my door
        It goes bad to worse, you said it first
        It's hopeless, we can't lift that curse
        'Cause we both know we ain't got self-control
        And I'll always come when you bang on my door</h1>
